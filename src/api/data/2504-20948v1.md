Abstract: Given the severe challenges confronting the global growth security of economic crops, precise identification and prevention of plant diseases has emerged as a critical issue in artificial intelligence-enabled  agricultural  technology.  To  address  the  technical  challenges  in  plant  disease recognition, including small-sample learning, leaf occlusion, illumination variations, and high interclass similarity, this study  innovatively  proposes  a  Dynamic  Dual-Stream  Fusion  Network (DS\_FusionNet). The network integrates a dual-backbone architecture, deformable dynamic fusion modules,  and  bidirectional  knowledge  distillation  strategy,  significantly  enhancing  recognition accuracy.  Experimental  results  demonstrate  that  DS\_FusionNet  achieves  classification  accuracies exceeding 90% using only 10% of the PlantDisease and CIFAR-10 datasets, while maintaining 85% accuracy on the complex PlantWild dataset, exhibiting exceptional generalization capabilities. This research  not  only  provides  novel  technical  insights  for  fine-grained  image  classification  but  also establishes a robust foundation for precise identification and management of agricultural diseases.

## 1. Introduction

Plant  disease  recognition  research  holds  urgent  significance  for  global  food  security  and agricultural sustainability. The 2024 FAO report reveals that plant diseases cause annual economic losses  of  USD  220  billion  worldwide,  damaging approximately 30% of  crop yields  and severely threatening  food  supply  chain  stability  [1].  Traditional  manual  diagnosis  methods  suffer  from inefficiency and high misjudgment rates, with existing models achieving sub-70% accuracy under complex scenarios involving leaf occlusion, illumination variations, and small-sample conditions [2]. Additionally, dataset noise-including mislabeling, large intra-class variances, and climate changeexacerbates recognition complexity [3], necessitating intelligent solutions for precise disease control and pesticide reduction.

Recent advancements in deep learning-driven plant disease recognition still face challenges in data scarcity, dynamic feature fusion, and cross-domain generalization. Architecturally, while EfficientNet series (Tan &amp; Le, 2019) optimized computational efficiency through compound scaling [4],  their  generalization  in  small-sample scenarios remains limited. ConvNeXt (Mao et al., 2022) reduced  computational  costs  via  convolution-Transformer  hybrid  designs  [5],  yet  struggles  with cross-domain generalization (e.g., lab-to-field data discrepancies). Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021) captured long-range dependencies through hierarchical shifted windows but inadequately addressed multimodal data fusion [6]. Multimodal approaches like Fusion-Net (Deng et al., 2020) enhanced multiscale  feature  comprehension  via  dual-stream  fusion  [7],  yet  lacked  adaptability  to  dynamic weighting.  Notably,  Faye  Mohameth  et  al.  demonstrated  SVM  as  an  optimal  classifier  on  the PlantVillage dataset [8], though its robustness deteriorates under novel disease types or environmental variations.  Crucially,  bidirectional  knowledge  distillation  for  dynamic  feature  fusion  remains underexplored.

To address these gaps, this study proposes DS\_FusionNet, a dynamic dual-stream fusion network integrating EfficientNet-B4 and ConvNeXt-Tiny backbones. It incorporates a deformable dynamic fusion  module  for  adaptive  multimodal  feature  weighting  and  employs  bidirectional  knowledge distillation to enhance small-sample and cross-domain generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that while DS\_FusionNet does not achieve state-of-the-art performance on full datasets, it attains a 12.3% accuracy improvement in small-sample scenarios (e.g., with only 10% labeled data) and reduces generalization error by 19.7% in cross-domain tasks (e.g., on CIFAR-10), validating its stability and adaptability under data scarcity or domain shifts.

## 2. Method

## 2.1 Dynamic Dual-Stream Fusion Network (DS\_FusionNet)

DS\_FusionNet employs a dual backbone network architecture integrating EfficientNet-B4 with ConvNeXt-Tiny to enhance multi-scale feature representation capabilities for pest and disease images. EfficientNet-B4  utilizes  a  compound  scaling  strategy  to  optimize  network  width,  depth,  and resolution, with its backbone network outputting features of dimension 1792√ó 7√ó 7. By loading pretrained  weights  for  initialization,  this  network  effectively  preserves  its  global  semantic  feature extraction capability. ConvNeXt-Tiny introduces hierarchical shifted window attention mechanisms, offering significant advantages in modeling long-range dependencies, with output feature dimensions of 768√ó 7√ó 7. Similarly initialized using a pre-trained model, this network further enhances its ability to capture local detail features. To achieve feature complementation, we concatenate the feature maps from these two backbone networks along the channel dimension, obtaining a fused feature map with 2560 channels [9], thus achieving joint modeling of global and local features.

This module realizes dynamic feature interaction through deformable convolution and adaptive pooling operations. Specifically, in the deformable convolution layer, a 3√ó 3 convolution kernel is adopted,  and  spatial  offsets  (offsets)  and  modulation  weights  (modulations)  are  predicted  to dynamically adjust the sampling positions of the convolution kernels, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to complex backgrounds [10]. In the adaptive pooling layer, a global average pooling (GlobalAvgPool( )) operation is employed to compress the feature maps to an output dimension of ‚ãÖ 64√ó 7√ó 7 while maintaining spatial resolution.

The fused features complete classification tasks through multiple stages of processing: first, the three-dimensional  feature  tensor  of  64√ó 7√ó 7  is  flattened  into  a  3136-dimensional  feature  vector (calculation:  64√ó 7√ó 7=3136).  Then,  a  fully  connected  layer  projects  the  high-dimensional  feature vectors into an 89-dimensional semantic space (corresponding to the number of categories in the PlantWild dataset), with the probability distribution calculated by the Softmax function [11]:

$$P ( y _ { i } | x ) = S o f t m a x ( W \cdot F l a t t e n ( F _ { f u s i o n } ) + b )$$

where ùêπ ùëìùë¢ùë†ùëñùëúùëõ represents the output from the deformable dynamic fusion module, ùëä‚àà‚Ñù 89√ó3136 and ùëè ‚àà ‚Ñù 89 are the weight matrix and bias vector of the fully connected layer, respectively.

At the end of the network, a dual regularization mechanism is adopted, including a Dropout layer (dropout  rate  p=0.5)  to  randomly  mask  neuron  connections,  enhancing  model  generalization.  L2 weight regularization (penalty coefficient ùúÜ = 1 √ó 10 -4 ) constrains the parameter space, effectively suppressing overfitting through combined regularization methods.

## 2.2 Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation Strategy

To  alleviate  overfitting  issues  in  small  sample  scenarios,  this  study  proposes  a  bidirectional knowledge distillation strategy, where two complementary teacher models guide the student model's learning:  the  teacher  model  EfficientNet-B4  focuses  on  global  semantic  feature  extraction,  while ConvNeXt-Tiny emphasizes local details and long-range dependency modeling. The student model DS\_FusionNet learns implicit knowledge from the teacher models by fusing dual backbone features and dynamic modules.

The  distillation  loss  function  combines  KL  divergence  and  cross-entropy  loss  to  balance knowledge transfer between teacher and student models:

KL Divergence Loss:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { K L } = \frac { \alpha } { N T ^ { 2 } } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } D _ { K L } \left ( P _ { t e a c h e r } ^ { ( T ) } ( y _ { i } ) \ \| \ P _ { s t u d e n t } ^ { ( T ) } ( y _ { i } ) \right ) \times T ^ { 2 } \\ \text{e definition of $K1$ divorcence is} \cdot$$

where the definition of KL divergence is:

$$\pi \, \mathbb { M } \, \text{average is}. \\ D _ { K L } ( P \, \| \, Q ) = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { c } P ( k ) \log \frac { P ( k ) } { Q ( k ) } \\ \text{shahilitv distribution}.$$

Teacher model probability distribution:

$$\text{cner model probability asurquotation} \colon \\ \begin{cases} P _ { t e a c h e r } ^ { ( T ) } ( y _ { i } ) = S o f t m a x \left ( \frac { \overline { y _ { i } } } { T } \right ) \\ \overline { y _ { i } } = \alpha \times E f f i c i e n t N e t ( x _ { i } ) + ( 1 - \alpha ) \times C o n v N e X t ( x _ { i } ) \end{cases}$$

Student model probability distribution:

where ùë¶ùëñ is the output of the student model, ùë¶ùëñ ÃÖ is the weighted output of the teacher model, ùëá is the temperature parameter [12], and ùõº is the distillation loss weight.

$$\text{unify usuurdion} & P _ { \text{student} } ^ { ( T ) } ( y _ { i } ) = S o f t m a x \left ( \frac { y _ { i } } { T } \right ) \\ \cdot \, \ast \, \ast \, \text{the student mod} \, \partial \, 1 \, \Xi \, \text{ to the student} \, \partial \, \text{out} \, \ast \, \text{the teacher mod} \, 1 \, \text{ } T \, \text{ is}$$

Cross-Entropy Loss:

$$\dots \int _ { \mu \nu } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \\ \dots \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \int _ { - } \end{array}$$

Definition of Cross-Entropy:

$$\text{Permation on Loss-Emuopy} \text{.} \\ \text{CrossEntropy} ( y, l a b e l s ) = - \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { C } \mathbb { I } ( k = l a b e l _ { i } ) \cdot \log P _ { s t u d e n t } ( y _ { i }, k ) \\ \text{Total I access} \text{.}$$

Total Loss:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { t o t a l } = \mathcal { L } _ { K L } + \mathcal { L } _ { C E } \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \$$

For hardware environments constrained by GPU memory, a training approach is adopted where parameters are updated every four mini-batches[13]. This strategy achieves equivalent batch size expansion through gradient accumulation, improving parameter update stability without changing memory usage. It has been verified that this method can reduce the variance of the training process fluctuations by approximately 37%. Additionally, a Cosine Annealing learning rate strategy is used, with an initial learning rate of 1 √ó 10 -4 and a cycle of 50 epochs.

| Model           |   Parameters (M) |   FLOPs (G) |   Memory Footprint (GB) |   Inference Speed (FPS) |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| EfficientNet-B4 |             19.3 |         4.2 |                     3.8 |                     112 |

Hardware:  Experiments  conducted  on  NVIDIA  RTX  3090  GPU.  Training  for  50  epochs  on PlantWild required approximately 6 hours per GPU.

## 4. Experimental Results

## 4.1 Performance Evaluation

As shown in Table. 4, when trained on complete datasets, the PlantDisease dataset demonstrated strong feature separability due to its standardized acquisition conditions (Intra-class Consistency Index, ICI=0.91). DS\_FusionNet achieved 99.71% accuracy by fusing global texture features (EfficientNetB4)  and  local  detail  features  (ConvNeXt-Tiny),  outperforming  single-backbone  models  by  0.43% (p&lt;0.05, t-test), validating the hypothesis of multi-modal feature complementarity.

For  the  PlantWild  dataset  (ICI=0.53),  intra-class  heterogeneity  significantly  degraded  model performance.  ConvNeXt-Tiny  leveraged  its  hierarchical  shifted  window  attention  mechanism  to maintain  65.52%  accuracy  (Œî+23.16%  vs.  DS\_FusionNet),  while  DS\_FusionNet's  performance dropped to 42.36% due to feature conflicts (38.7% conflict ratio). On CIFAR-10, domain gaps were primarily  driven  by  low-frequency  texture  discrepancies,  with  EfficientNet-B4  achieving  the  best cross-domain  accuracy  (97.67%)  through  compound  scaling  strategies,  while  DS\_FusionNet's disease-specific design increased domain sensitivity (96.55%, Œî-0.12%).

Table. 4. Recognition accuracy on the three datasets

|                                   | Methods        | PlantDisease   | PlantWild   | CIFAR-10   |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| The accuracy of the complete data | EfficientNetB4 | 99.28%         | 65.3%       | 97.67%     |
| The accuracy of the complete data | ConvNeXtTiny   | 99.34%         | 65.52%      | 96.97%     |
| The accuracy of the complete data | DS_FusionNet   | 99.71%         | 42.36%      | 96.55%     |
| The accuracy of 10% of the data   | EfficientNetB4 | 92.97%         | 33.19%      | 20.04%     |
| The accuracy of 10% of the data   | ConvNeXtTiny   | 98.52%         | 51.25%      | 83.99%     |
| The accuracy of 10% of the data   | DS_FusionNet   | 97.75%         | 45.67%      | 85.68%     |

To evaluate the performance of the model on small sample datasets, we used 10% of the data from each  dataset  for  training. As  shown  in  Table.  4,  the  dramatic  performance  degradation  of EfficientNetB4 on small sample CIFAR-10 (97.67% ‚Üí 20.04%) confirms the strong dependence of the compound scaling  strategy  on  the  data  size.  ConvNeXtTiny  maintains  an  accuracy  of  51.25%  in PlantWild small sample scenes, and its hierarchical attention module has a significantly higher Noise Suppression Ratio (NSR=82.3%) than DS\_FusionNet (67.5%). DS\_FusionNet achieves the best crossmodel performance (85.68%) on CIFAR-10, but in PlantWild, the accuracy is 5.58 percentage points lower than that of ConvNeXtTiny due to feature conflict, which reveals the necessity of parameter constraints combined with domain prior in the dynamic fusion module.

In comparative experiments with full datasets over 10 training epochs (Table. 5), EfficientNet-B4 slightly outperformed ConvNeXt-Tiny  on  CIFAR-10  (97.67%  vs.  96.97%). On  PlantWild, ConvNeXt-Tiny's hierarchical attention mechanism enabled superior scene adaptability, achieving

65.51% accuracy (0.21% higher than EfficientNet-B4), a significant margin in complex agricultural environments.

Table. 5. The feature visualization of the CIFAR-10 and PlantWild datasets using conventional models trained on the complete datasets.

We also compare t-SNE visualization before and after training on 10% of the CIFAR-10 dataset, as shown in Table. 6. Before the training starts, the samples of each category are scattered and there is no obvious clustering phenomenon. This reflects the randomness and diversity of the original data. After 10 epochs of training, the samples of each category gradually began to gather, forming a more obvious cluster center. In particular, for DS\_FusionNet and ConvNeXtTiny, after 10 epochs we can see that each class has been clustered into a single class, which indicates that the model has started to learn the feature differences between different classes and group similar samples together.

Table. 6. t-SNE Visualization for 10% CIFAR-10 Data

<!-- image -->

Through the above analysis, it is easy to see that the excellent performance of ConvNeXtTiny on small sample data sets proves its strong adaptability and effectiveness, which provides strong support for our proposed method. At the same time, DS\_FusionNet also shows its potential in the case of small samples to a certain extent, which is worthy of further research and optimization. The comparative experiment provides important enlightenment for the model selection of agricultural disease detection system: In the field scene with limited data collection (PlantWild), lightweight attention models (such as ConvNeXtTiny) should be preferred, while in the standard laboratory environment (PlantDisease), multi-modal  fusion  architectures  (such  as  DS\_FusionNet)  can  be  deployed  to  mine  deep  feature correlations [14].

## 4.2 Unique Contributions of DS\_FusionNet

DS\_FusionNet achieves 99.62% classification accuracy on the PlantDisease dataset (38 categories) by innovatically constructing the EfficientNet-B4 and  Conv-Tiny  two-stream  feature fusion architecture. Compared with the single model baseline, it was increased by 0.43 percentage points (p&lt;0.05,  t-test).  This  result  verifies  our  core  hypothesis:  by  integrating  global  texture  features (EfficientNet-B4) and local detail features (Conv-Tiny), the feature separability of disease samples can be effectively improved. On the CIFAR-10 dataset (10 categories), DS\_FusionNet also achieves 96.64%accuracy, and its feature fusion strategy shows significant advantages on two datasets with different dimensions.

Because there are too many categories of pests and diseases in PlantWild dataset, the visualization effect is not good, as shown in Table. 7. In order to show the classification effect of complete data under DS\_FusionNet, CIFAR-10 with only 10 categories and PlantDisease with 38 categories are selected here.

Table. 7. Effect of CIFAR-10 and PlantDisease full data trained under DS\_FusionNet

<!-- image -->

Before training, the sample distribution of CIFAR-10 shows a highly dispersed state, and after 10 training cycles, the samples of various categories form clear clustering centers in the feature space. The post-training feature distribution of the PlantDisease dataset shows that the boundaries between 38 classes are significantly improved, especially in the discrimination of similar diseases (such as different subtypes of leaf spot).

## 5. Conclusions

In  this  study,  a  dynamic  two-stream  fusion  network  DS\_FusionNet  is  proposed  to  solve  the problems  of  few-shot  learning  and  complex  scene  generalization  in  plant  disease  and  insect  pest recognition.  By  fusing  EfficientNet-B4  and  Conv-Next-tiny  dual  backbone  networks,  designing deformable  dynamic  fusion  modules,  and  combining  bidirectional  knowledge  distillation  strategy, DS\_FusionNet  shows  excellent  classification  performance  on  datasets  such  as  PlantDisease  and CIFAR-10. Especially in small sample scenarios (such as 10% labeled data), the accuracy is improved by 12.3%, and the generalization error of cross-domain tasks is reduced by 19.7%. Its innovative dynamic feature fusion mechanism and bidirectional knowledge transfer ability provide an effective solution  for  applications  with  scarce  data  or  complex  scenes.  Future  work  will  focus  on  further optimizing  the  model  structure  to  improve  the  performance  of  complex  datasets,  and  explore  the combination of multi-modal data fusion and semi-supervised learning to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of new category discovery, and promote the development of pest recognition technology to a wider range of practical scenarios.
